### For developers
Running Tc in dev mode *should* be simple. If the instructions below aren't
working then please open an issue.

- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- In one terminal: `npm run dev-watch-files`
- Once the above is done, in another terminal: `npm run dev-launch-electron`

After you edit some files, restart terminal 2 to re-launch electron. No need
to touch terminal 1
